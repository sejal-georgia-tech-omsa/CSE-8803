### Lesson 1: Deep Learning CNN

Deep Learning
- deep neural networks learn hierarchical feature representations

Smaller Network: ANN
- we know it is good to learn a small model
- from this fully connected model, do we really need all the edges?
- can some of these be shared?
- when it comes to images, some patterns are much smaller than the whole image
  - can represent a small region (like the beak of a bird) with fewer parameters

Why CNN works well for images
- we can train a lot of "small" detectors and each detector must "move around"?

Can we use CNN for NLP?
- yes, but we do need to prepare a dataset which is readable to a CNN model like an image which is a matrix
