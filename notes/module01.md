## Topic 1

### Lesson 1: Class Overview

- Why Natural Language Processing?
  - texts and documents are everywhere
  - hundreds of languages in the world
  - primary information artifacts in our lives
  - large volumes of textual data

- Examples of Applications of NLP
  - establish authorship, authenticity; plagiarism detection
  - classification of genres for narratives
  - tone classification; sentiment analysis (online reviews, twitter, social media)
  - code: syntax analysis (e.g., find common bugs from students' answers)
  - machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)

- What makes NLP challenging?
  - interdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of linguistics and machine learning
  - ambiguity at multiple levels in the human language:
    - lexical (word level) ambiguity-- different meanings of words
    - syntactic (sentence level) ambiguity-- different ways to parse the sentence
    - interpreting partial information-- how to interpret pronouns
    - contextual information-- context of the sentence may affect the meaning of the sentence

- What will you learn in the class?
  - preprocessing
    - how to clean texts and documents
    - tokenization
    - reducing the inflectional forms of a word
      - stemming
      - lemmatization
    - normalization
  - text representation
    - one hot encoding
    - BoW (bag of words)
    - TF-IDF
    - embeddings
  - overview of classification methods
    - Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM
    - Perceptron
    - Neural Network
  - overview of deep learning
    - convolutional neural network
    - recurrent neural network
    - long short-term memory (LSTM)
  - overview of topic modeling
    - principal component analysis
    - singular value decomposition
    - latent dirichlet allocation
  - overview of transformer models
    - bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
    - generative pre-trained transformer
